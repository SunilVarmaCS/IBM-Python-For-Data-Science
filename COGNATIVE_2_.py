#Another Example

#Branchings

#Branching allows us to run different statements for different input.

#The "if" Statement
age = 19
if (age > 18):
    print("You can Enter the concert")
print("You can Move on")

#The "else" Statement 
age = 17
if (age > 18):
    print("You can Enter the Concert")
else:
    print("Meet to the Staff Members")

print("Then You can Go the Concert")

#The Elif Statement

age = 20

if(age > 18):
    print("You can Enter")

elif(age == 18):
    print("Go to the Pink Floyd")

else:
    print("Go to Staff Office")

print("Then you can move on")

#Logic Operators

#Logic Operations take boolean values and produce different boolean values  

#Not Operator

print(not(True))
print(not(False))

#or Operator

A = False
B = False
print(A or B)

A = False
B = True
print(A or B)

A = True
B = False
print(A or B)

A = True

    print("The Album was made in the 70's or 90's")
else:

#And Operations

A = False

print(A and B)
print(A & B)

album_year = 1983
